This repository contains one project: **`leLab-main/`**. It's a fork of
[LeLab](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/tree/main/lelab) (the official web GUI for
[LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)) with an added **gamepad input mode**: a PS5
DualSense, Xbox-style pad, or similar controller can drive the SO-101 follower arm directly, for
teleoperation *and* dataset recording, as a full alternative to a leader arm. You pick the
input mode per-robot in the GUI with a toggle switch.

Everything below is written for someone setting this up **for the first time, on a computer that
has never run it before.** There are two ways in: a single command (below), or a step-by-step
manual setup further down for anyone who wants to see the code as they go.

---

## Quick Start (one command)

If you just want to run LeLab GamePad Version and don't plan to edit the code, this single
command does everything: installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (a fast Python package
manager) if it isn't already on your machine, installs LeLab GamePad Version with it, and starts
the app. Nothing else needs to be pre-installed except PowerShell itself, which every Windows
machine already has.

Open PowerShell and paste:

```powershell
if (-not (Get-Command uv -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) { irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex; $env:Path = "$HOME\.local\bin;$env:Path" }; uv tool install --python 3.13 "git+https://github.com/SustainableLivingLab/LeLab_GamePadVersion.git#subdirectory=leLab-main" --reinstall; lelab-gamepad
```

`--reinstall` makes `uv` fetch and install the current code fresh every time you run this command,
instead of reusing whatever was already installed. Use this exact command (with `--reinstall`)
whenever you're installing for the first time, or want to pick up the latest fixes and features
later; it's harmless to run repeatedly. It's the only part of this command you'd ever drop: once
you're on a version you're happy with and just want to launch the app day-to-day, use the shorter
`lelab-gamepad` command by itself instead (see "To run it again later" below), which skips the
install step entirely and starts instantly.

`--python 3.13` tells `uv` which Python to run the app on; it downloads and manages that version
itself if you don't already have it, completely separately from any other Python already on your
machine. This is required, not optional: one of this app's dependencies (`pygame`, used for
gamepad input) doesn't yet publish a ready-to-use build for the newest Python versions, and
without this flag `uv` may pick one of those and fail partway through install with a `pygame`
build error.

This installs a plain CPU build of PyTorch by default, the same way the original LeLab's own
one-liner does. That's all calibration, gamepad teleoperation, and recording ever need locally;
training itself runs on Hugging Face's cloud, not your machine. If you want a CUDA build for
faster local policy rollout, install it yourself afterward with `pip install torch --index-url
https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124` (match the CUDA version to your GPU driver) from inside
the tool's environment, or follow the manual setup below.

This is a separate command from upstream LeLab's own `lelab`, so it installs and runs side by
side without needing to uninstall anything.

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8000`. The first run downloads
everything the app needs (a few hundred MB), so expect it to take a few minutes; every run after
that starts in seconds.

**To run it again later** (no need to repeat the install), plug in your gamepad and the SO-101
follower arm, then open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
lelab-gamepad
```

**To update to the latest version** later, run the Quick Start one-liner above again.

**To use different ports** (the defaults are 8000 for the app, and 8080 for the frontend in
`--dev` mode), pass them as flags:

```powershell
lelab-gamepad --port 9000
lelab-gamepad --dev --port 9000 --frontend-port 9090
```

If you changed the ports, pass the same flags to stop LeLab: `lelab-gamepad --stop --port 9000`.

If this fails for any reason, or you want to see/edit the actual source code, follow the manual
setup below instead: it's the same install, just done step by step so you can see what's
happening at each stage.

---

## Manual setup

Everything below is the same install the Quick Start one-liner does, just spelled out step by
step: useful if the one-liner didn't work, or if you want to see/edit the source code.

### What you need before starting

- **A Windows, macOS, or Linux computer.** (This guide's exact commands are for Windows +
  PowerShell; macOS/Linux users run the same steps in a regular terminal, swapping backslashes for
  forward slashes where it matters.)
- **An SO-101 follower arm**, assembled and connected to the computer via USB.
- **A game controller.** Tested with a PS5 DualSense and a wired Xbox-style pad (e.g. Logitech G
  F310). Works wired (USB), via a wireless USB dongle, or paired over Bluetooth; any of the
  three is fine, as long as Windows/macOS/Linux shows it as a connected controller *before* you
  open LeLab. (Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Add device, or Settings → Devices → Game
  controllers, to check.)
- **Git.** Download: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>. During install, accept the defaults.
- **Python 3.12 or newer.** Download: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. **On the first
  install screen, tick "Add python.exe to PATH"**: this is the single most common setup mistake.
- **Node.js 18 or newer** (only needed if you plan to rebuild the frontend yourself; most people
  can skip this, since the built frontend is already included in this repo). Download:
  <https://nodejs.org/> (choose the LTS version).

You do **not** need a leader arm. A GPU is optional: training a policy runs on Hugging Face's cloud
infrastructure, not on your machine, so a plain CPU-only PyTorch install (what `pip install -e .`
gives you by default) is all calibration, gamepad teleoperation, and recording ever need locally.
A local GPU only speeds up local policy rollout, if you use that feature.

### Step 1: Get the code

Open a terminal (PowerShell on Windows) and run:

```powershell
git clone <this-repo-url> LeLab_GamePadVersion
cd LeLab_GamePadVersion\leLab-main
```

Replace `<this-repo-url>` with this repository's actual clone URL (the green "Code" button on
its GitHub page, then copy the HTTPS URL).

Everything from here on happens **inside `leLab-main`**. If a command fails with something like
"file not found" or "no such file or directory," first check you're in the right folder:

```powershell
# Windows
Get-Location   # should end in ...\LeLab_GamePadVersion\leLab-main

# macOS/Linux
pwd            # should end in .../LeLab_GamePadVersion/leLab-main
```

### Step 2: Install LeLab (Python side)

Still inside `leLab-main`, run:

```powershell
pip install -e .
```

This single command installs everything: FastAPI, LeRobot itself (pulled from LeRobot's GitHub,
pinned to a known-good version), the Feetech servo driver for the SO-101, and `pygame` for
reading the gamepad. **It downloads and builds a fair amount: expect this to take 5-15 minutes**
depending on your internet connection. That's normal; let it finish.

If it finishes with no red `ERROR` lines, you're done with this step. A few yellow `WARNING`
lines (deprecation notices, script-not-on-PATH notices) are harmless and expected.

### If `pip install -e .` fails

- **`'pip' is not recognized`**: Python wasn't added to PATH during install. Reinstall Python
  and tick "Add python.exe to PATH", or run `python -m pip install -e .` instead of bare `pip`.
- **A `torch`/CUDA-related error**: usually means pip picked a CUDA build that doesn't match your
  GPU driver. This app doesn't require a GPU (training runs on Hugging Face's cloud, not your
  machine; a local GPU only speeds up local policy rollout), so just force the CPU build and move on:
  ```powershell
  pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
  pip install -e .
  ```
- **Anything mentioning `av`, `datasets`, or `torchcodec`**: run the install again; these
  sometimes need a second pass to resolve on a fresh machine:
  ```powershell
  pip install -e .
  ```
- **On Windows, if `opencv-python-headless` and `opencv-python` conflict** (camera preview
  windows come up black or throw an import error), run:
  ```powershell
  pip uninstall opencv-python-headless -y
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

### Step 3: Confirm the install

```powershell
lelab-gamepad --help
```

You should see a short usage message (`--dev`, `--rebuild`, `--no-open`, `--stop`). If instead
you get `'lelab-gamepad' is not recognized`, the install succeeded but the `lelab-gamepad` command
isn't on your PATH: either close and reopen your terminal (this fixes it 90% of the time on
Windows), or run it as `python -m lelab.scripts.lelab --help` instead everywhere in this guide.

### Step 4: Run it

For everyday use (this is what you want almost every time):

```powershell
lelab-gamepad
```

This starts the server, and **your browser should open automatically** to the app at
`http://localhost:8000`. If it doesn't open automatically, open that URL yourself.

To stop it: go back to the terminal window and press `Ctrl+C`. If it ever gets stuck or you want
to force-stop a previous run:

```powershell
lelab-gamepad --stop
```

### Developer / hot-reload mode

If you're going to edit the code and want changes to show up live without restarting:

```powershell
lelab-gamepad --dev
```

This runs two servers together: a Vite frontend on `:8080` (hot-reloads on file save) and the
Python backend on `:8000` (auto-restarts on file save). Open `http://localhost:8080`.

### Step 5: First-time setup inside the app

1. **Plug in the follower arm** via USB, if you haven't already.
2. On the landing page, click the robot name dropdown → type a name → **Create**.
3. A new robot tile appears. It has a small toggle switch (Cable ↔ Gamepad icon): **click it to
   switch to Gamepad mode.** In gamepad mode you only need to configure the follower arm; there's
   no leader arm step.
4. Click the **gear icon (Configure)** on the tile. Pick the follower's serial port (use the
   auto-detect button if you're not sure which one it is), then run through calibration.
   It's a short guided flow, just follow the on-screen instructions.
5. Back on the landing page, click the **small controller icon (Test gamepad)** next to the
   dropdown (visible before you've even picked a robot, and again on the tile in gamepad mode).
   If no controller is detected yet, this view shows step-by-step setup instructions for **Wired
   USB**, **2.4G Dongle**, and **Bluetooth**; pick whichever way you're connecting and follow the
   steps. Once detected, it switches to a live view of your controller's sticks and buttons:
   wiggle the sticks and press some buttons, and you should see the bars and button grid react in
   real time. If nothing reacts, see **Troubleshooting → Gamepad not detected** below.
6. Once the tile shows **"Ready"** (green), click **Teleoperation**. Press **Cross (✕ / A)** on
   the controller to start driving the arm. See **Default Gamepad Controls** below for the full
   mapping.
7. To record a dataset instead of just driving the arm live, go back to the landing page and use
   the **Record** flow the same way. Gamepad mode works there too, using the same controls above
   plus the on-screen recording buttons (start episode, re-record, stop).

That's the whole loop: create a robot → gamepad mode → configure the follower → calibrate → test
the controller → teleoperate or record.

## Default Gamepad Controls

These are the out-of-the-box control mappings, confirmed on a PS5 DualSense and a wired
Logitech G F310 (both report the same axis order and face-button layout on this app's supported
platforms). Arm-driving controls (sticks, D-pad, triggers, Cross, Triangle) work identically in
**both teleoperation and recording**: you fly the arm with the gamepad in either mode. Circle
only applies to teleoperation; during recording, episode start/next/re-record/stop are always the
on-screen buttons, never a gamepad button.

| Control | Raw index | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Left stick, left/right | Axis 0 | Shoulder pan |
| Left stick, up/down | Axis 1 | Shoulder lift |
| Right stick, up/down | Axis 3 | Elbow flex |
| Right stick, left/right | Axis 2 | Wrist roll |
| D-pad up | Hat, or button 11 | Wrist flex up |
| D-pad down | Hat, or button 12 | Wrist flex down |
| Left trigger (L2 / LT) | Axis 4 | Open gripper |
| Right trigger (R2 / RT) | Axis 5 | Close gripper |
| Cross / A | Button 0 | Toggle arm motion on/off (arm holds its current position while off) |
| Triangle / Y | Button 3 | Smoothly return to the position the arm was in when the session started |
| Circle / B | Button 1 | Stop the session (**teleoperation only**) |

**Arm motion is off by default when a session starts**: press Cross/A once before touching the
sticks, or nothing will move. Stick deflection controls *speed*, not position: how far you push a
stick sets how fast that joint moves, not where it goes, since a stick naturally re-centers to
zero when released. The D-pad is auto-detected as either a hat (most Xbox-layout pads) or two
separate buttons (the DualSense); you don't need to configure which.

If your controller reports axes/buttons in a different order (some third-party pads do), or a
control moves the wrong direction, these constants live in
[`leLab-main/lelab/gamepad_teleop.py`](leLab-main/lelab/gamepad_teleop.py) and can be edited to
match your hardware. The **Test gamepad** view (see Step 5 above) shows you exactly which axis
or button index changes as you move each stick, which is the fastest way to work out the right
numbers for an unfamiliar controller. `JOINT_CONFIG` holds each joint's axis index and sign;
`BUTTON_DPAD_UP` / `BUTTON_DPAD_DOWN` hold the D-pad's button fallback indices; `BUTTON_START_PAUSE`
/ `BUTTON_HOME` / `BUTTON_QUIT` hold the three face-button indices.

## Troubleshooting

### "Application Control policy has blocked this file" when `lelab-gamepad` tries to launch

Windows Smart App Control (or a similar endpoint policy on a work machine) blocks freshly-built,
unsigned executables by default. `lelab-gamepad.exe` is a console-script shim `uv` builds on your
own machine during install, same as upstream LeLab's own `lelab.exe`, so this can happen with
either. To fix it: open **Settings → Privacy & security → Windows Security → App & browser
control → Smart App Control**, turn it off, then run `lelab-gamepad` again. On a company-managed
machine, you may need your IT admin to allow it instead.

### Gamepad not detected

- Make sure the controller is connected **at the operating-system level first**: Python only
  sees what the OS already sees. Check:
  - **Windows:** Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Devices (Bluetooth) or Settings → Devices and
    Printers (USB/wired). The controller should be listed there.
  - Try unplugging and replugging (USB) or re-pairing (Bluetooth), then reopen the "Test gamepad"
    view. No need to restart LeLab.
- Only **one** application can hold the controller at a time in this app. If you have the "Test
  gamepad" view open in one browser tab and try to start teleoperation in another, close the test
  view first.
- Some Bluetooth stacks briefly show the controller as connected before it's actually ready to
  send data. Wait a few seconds after pairing before opening the test view.
- **Windows: paired over Bluetooth but "Test gamepad" still says "No gamepad detected"** even
  after waiting and retrying: check Device Manager → **"Human Interface Devices"** vs
  **"Game controllers"**. If the paired controller only shows up as a generic HID device and not
  under "Game controllers", Windows itself never classified it as a joystick, and no amount of
  retrying in the app will fix it. This is a known issue with some controllers over Bluetooth
  (the PS5 DualSense in particular): unpair and re-pair, try toggling the controller's connection
  mode (many controllers have a separate "PC mode" button combo distinct from console pairing
  mode), or fall back to a **USB cable or a wireless USB dongle** for that controller, which
  reliably registers as a proper game controller on Windows.

### "Could not connect to the follower arm on COM_"

- Check the arm is powered on and the USB cable is fully seated.
- Use the auto-detect port button on the Configure page rather than typing a port name: the
  actual COM/serial port number is specific to your machine and can change between reboots.
- On Windows, check Device Manager → Ports (COM & LPT) to confirm which port the arm's USB-serial
  chip is on.

### `lelab-gamepad` opens but the page is blank / errors in the browser console

- Hard-refresh the page (`Ctrl+Shift+R`).
- If you were previously running `lelab-gamepad --dev` and switched to plain `lelab-gamepad` (or
  vice versa), run `lelab-gamepad --stop` first, then start again cleanly.

### Port 8000 or 8080 already in use

```powershell
lelab-gamepad --stop
```

then start again. This frees both ports if a previous run didn't shut down cleanly.

### Still stuck

Check the terminal window LeLab is running in: errors are logged there with a full description,
which is almost always more specific than anything in the browser. If you're not sure what a
particular error means, copy the full error text (not just the last line) before asking for help.

## What's different from upstream LeLab

- **Gamepad teleoperation and recording**: a new input mode alongside the existing leader-arm
  mode, selectable per-robot via a toggle switch on the robot tile. The leader-arm path is
  completely untouched; this is purely additive.
- **Live gamepad test view**: a "Test gamepad" button shows real-time stick/button/D-pad values
  in the browser, so you can confirm your controller is detected and mapped correctly before
  trusting it with the robot. When nothing's detected yet, it also walks you through connecting
  via Wired USB, a 2.4G Dongle, or Bluetooth.
- **Pause, continue, and publish a recording**: stopping a recording session always saves what
  was collected so far to a valid local dataset. The page you land on afterward offers a
  "Continue Recording" button to append more episodes later (with the same robot connection
  carried forward automatically), alongside the existing Hub upload flow.
- **Gamepad drops don't end the session**: if the controller loses connection mid-teleoperation
  or mid-recording (a Bluetooth hiccup, a dongle going out of range, a USB unplug), the arm holds
  its last position and the app keeps retrying the connection in the background instead of
  crashing the session. A red "reconnecting" badge shows on the Teleoperation and Recording pages
  while it's out; control resumes automatically once it's back.
- Everything else (calibration, camera setup, training, replay, Hub upload) works exactly as in
  upstream LeLab.
